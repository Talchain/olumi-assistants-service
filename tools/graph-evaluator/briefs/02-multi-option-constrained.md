We're a UK fintech startup deciding how to expand internationally. Our options are entering Germany (large market, heavy regulation), Brazil (high growth, currency risk), or Japan (stable, high barrier to entry). We need to achieve 15% revenue growth within 18 months while keeping total expansion costs below £2M. Our current team is 35 people with no international experience. We also need to decide whether to hire locally or relocate existing staff.
