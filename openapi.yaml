      summary: Draft decision graph (SSE only)
      description: |
        Dedicated streaming endpoint that always returns Server-Sent Events (SSE).

        **Benefits over `/assist/draft-graph` with Accept header:**
        - Explicit URL for preflighting and caching
        - Clearer API surface
        - Better CDN/proxy support

        **Streaming Behavior:**
        - Initial `DRAFTING` event sent immediately
        - Fixture graph shown after 2.5s if LLM is still processing
        - Final `COMPLETE` event contains actual graph

      summary: Draft decision graph (CEE v1)
      description: |
        Cognitive Enhancement Engine (CEE) v1 **Draft My Model** endpoint.

        This endpoint drafts a decision graph from a natural language brief using
        the engine's canonical GraphV1 / GraphPatchV1 contracts and the CEE
        validation pipeline. The underlying graph and patch payloads are the
        same engine contracts used by `/assist/draft-graph`; CEE adds trace,
        quality, validation metadata and archetype classification on top.

        **Rate limiting (CEE‑specific):**
        - Default: 5 requests per 60 seconds per API key (or client IP fallback).
        - Configurable via `CEE_DRAFT_RATE_LIMIT_RPM`.
        - Exceeding this per‑feature limit returns `CEEErrorResponseV1` with
          `code="CEE_RATE_LIMIT"`, `retryable=true`, a `Retry-After` header,
          and `details.retry_after_seconds` describing when it is safe to retry.

        It uses the same CEE validation pipeline as `/assist/v1/draft-graph` including:
        - Single goal enforcement
        - Preflight brief readiness assessment
        - Clarification enforcement
        - Full graph validation and repair

        **SSE Events:**
        - `stage: DRAFTING` - Initial event indicating draft generation has started
        - `stage: COMPLETE` - Final event containing the complete response payload
        - `resume` - Resume token for connection recovery (if Redis available)
        - Heartbeat comments every 10 seconds to keep connection alive

        **Rate limiting (CEE‑specific):**
        - Default: 20 requests per 60 seconds per API key (or client IP fallback).
        - Configurable via `CEE_STREAM_RATE_LIMIT_RPM`.
        - Exceeding this limit returns an SSE error event with `CEE_RATE_LIMIT`.

        **Degraded Mode:**
        - If Redis is unavailable, streaming continues but without resume/recovery support.
        - The `X-SSE-Degraded` header indicates degraded mode.

      summary: Convert natural language to probability (CEE v1)
      description: |
        Cognitive Enhancement Engine (CEE) v1 **Belief Elicitation** endpoint.

        Converts natural language probability expressions to normalized 0-1 values.
        Handles qualitative terms ("likely", "probably"), percentages ("70%", "about 80%"),
        fractions ("3 in 4", "1/2"), and ambiguous expressions that need clarification.

        This endpoint is deterministic, does **not** call any LLMs for known patterns,
        and targets sub-50ms latency. Ambiguous expressions return a clarifying question
        with clickable options for the user.

        Use this when eliciting belief values from users for priors or edge weights.

      description: |
        Cognitive Enhancement Engine (CEE) v1 **Utility Weight Suggestions** endpoint.

        Suggests relative importance weights for outcome nodes in a decision graph.
        Uses semantic analysis of node labels and decision context to infer priorities.
        Weights are normalized to sum to 1.0.

        This endpoint is deterministic, does **not** call any LLMs when semantic signals
        are clear, and targets sub-100ms latency. When applicable, provides alternative
        weighting schemes (e.g., risk-averse, growth-focused, balanced).

        Use this when users need help assigning utility weights to outcomes.

      description: |
        Cognitive Enhancement Engine (CEE) v1 **Edge Function Suggestion** endpoint.

        Suggests non-linear edge function types based on pattern matching of node
        labels and relationship descriptions. Supports:
        - `linear` (default): Output scales proportionally with input
        - `diminishing_returns`: Initial inputs have strong effects that taper off
        - `threshold`: Output only activates after input reaches critical level
        - `s_curve`: Slow start, rapid middle growth, then saturation

        This endpoint is deterministic, does **not** call any LLMs, and targets
        sub-50ms latency. Use this to suggest appropriate edge functions for PLoT's
        non-linear edge modeling feature.

        This endpoint provides a structured explanation of a decision graph

        For v1 this endpoint is deterministic and does not perform additional
        LLM calls; it derives explanations directly from the supplied

        sub-50ms latency. All label sanitisation (removing question marks, prefixes,
        etc.) is handled automatically.

        Use this after running inference to generate polished recommendation prose
        for UI display.

      description: |
        Cognitive Enhancement Engine (CEE) v1 **ISL Synthesis** endpoint.

        Converts ISL (Inference & Structure Learning) quantitative analysis results
        into human-readable narratives. Takes sensitivity, VoI (Value of Information),
        tipping point, and robustness data and generates clear explanations for
        decision-makers.

        This endpoint is deterministic, does **not** call any LLMs, and targets
        sub-50ms latency.

        Use this after running ISL analysis to generate narrative explanations
        suitable for executive presentation.

      description: |
        Cognitive Enhancement Engine (CEE) v1 **Ask** endpoint.

        UI-facing entrypoint for the "ask about this decision" experience.
        Accepts questions anchored to the graph and returns model-bound responses
        that always contain actionable content.

        **Key Features:**
        - Intent inference from message text if not explicitly provided
        - Model-bound invariant: responses always contain model_actions, highlights, or follow_up_question
        - Graph ID validation for all responses
        - Redis session caching with graceful degradation

        **Supported Intents:**
        - `explain` / `clarify`: Grounded to selected nodes/edges; includes highlights
        - `repair`: Propose concrete model_actions to fix/improve structure
        - `ideate`: Generate alternatives or new ideas
        - `compare`: Compare options or paths
        - `challenge`: Challenge assumptions or beliefs

        **Model-Bound Invariant:**
        Every response MUST contain at least one of:
        - `model_actions`: Array of graph patch operations
        - `highlights`: Array of elements to visually emphasize
        - `follow_up_question`: Clarifying question for the user

        This endpoint provides the foundation for collaborative decision modeling
        where the AI assistant helps users understand, improve, and refine their
        decision graphs.
