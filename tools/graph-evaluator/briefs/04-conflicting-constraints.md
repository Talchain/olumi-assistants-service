We're a Series A healthtech startup with 18 months of runway. The board wants us to achieve 3x user growth this year while simultaneously cutting our burn rate by 30%. Our two main options are: invest heavily in a self-serve product (lower CAC but requires significant engineering spend upfront) or double down on enterprise sales (higher margins but longer cycles and more headcount). A new NHS data regulation is expected in Q3 that could either open up or restrict our access to patient data, which affects both strategies differently.
