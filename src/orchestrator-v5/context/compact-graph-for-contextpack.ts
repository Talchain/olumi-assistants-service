/**
 * V5 Phase 1 — graph compaction adapter for the ContextPack.
 *
 * The V4 `compactGraph()` utility (src/orchestrator/context/graph-compact.ts)
 * takes a strict Zod-parsed `GraphV3T` and produces a deterministic, compact
 * projection (~800–1200 tokens for a 10-node graph). The V5 TurnExecutor
 * receives a permissive `GraphStateIngress` at its boundary. This adapter
 * bridges the two so the ContextPack presented to Sonnet uses the compact
 * form instead of full-JSON passthrough.
 *
 * On strict-parse failure (ingress shape that doesn't satisfy GraphV3), the
 * adapter falls back to a structural projection — the same pattern used by
 * `graphStateToGraphV3` in handlers/edit-graph-dispatch.ts. Required GraphV3
 * fields the ingress doesn't carry (edge.strength object, effect_direction,
 * exists_probability) are stamped with inert defaults so `compactGraph` can
 * still run; those defaults never mislead Sonnet because the compactor drops
 * std / uncertainty and maps zero-mean edges to `undefined` plain_interpretation.
 *
 * The full graph remains available to the validator via `graphLookupForValidate`
 * in turn-executor.ts — only the Sonnet-facing ContextPack is compacted.
