/**
 * Conversation history, bounded in both directions.
 *
 * ⛔ FOUND IN SELF-REVIEW BEFORE DEPLOY. `SessionBindingRegistry` caps at 500
 * and `ProposalStore` at 200, and this — the store that grows FASTEST — was an
 * unbounded `Map`. Two different problems were hiding in it:
 *
 *   1. process memory grows with every scenario ever touched, for ever;
 *   2. worse, the whole history is replayed to the model on EVERY turn, so a
 *      long conversation costs linearly more tokens and time each turn and
 *      eventually exceeds the context window. That one is a user-visible
 *      failure, not just housekeeping.
 *
 * ⛔ TRIMMING MUST NOT BREAK THE PROTOCOL. The items are Responses-API items:
 * a `function_call` and its `function_call_output` are a PAIR, and a reasoning
 * item belongs with the call that follows it. Cutting at an arbitrary index can
 * orphan a `function_call_output`, which the API rejects. So the trim only ever
 * cuts at the start of a user message — a point where nothing is half-finished.

 *   POST /agent/v1/turn status=502 duration_ms=27505
 *
 * The cause was in the loop (it answered only the first of several parallel
 * calls) and is fixed there. This is the structural guard, so the invariant
 * does not depend on every future writer getting it right: a stored history is
 * VALID INPUT by construction, and one bad turn costs that turn instead of the
 * whole session.
 *
 * ⚠ It drops the CALL, never the output. An orphaned output is the API's other
 * rejection and dropping a call cannot create one, because the output is
 * removed with it.
