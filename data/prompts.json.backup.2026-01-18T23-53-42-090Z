If this is not true for any decision node, your graph is incorrect and you must adjust the belief values so they form a proper probability distribution before responding.\n- Every edge with belief or weight MUST have structured provenance:\n  - source: document filename, metric name, or \"hypothesis\"\n  - quote: short citation or statement (≤100 chars)\n  - location: extract from document markers ([PAGE N], [ROW N], line N:) when citing documents\n  - provenance_source: \"document\" | \"metric\" | \"hypothesis\"\n- Documents include location markers:\n  - PDFs: [PAGE 1], [PAGE 2], etc. marking page boundaries\n  - CSVs: [ROW 1] for header, [ROW 2], [ROW 3], etc. for data rows\n  - TXT/MD: Line numbers like \"1:\", \"2:\", \"3:\", etc. at start of each line\n- When citing documents, use these markers to determine the correct location value\n- Node IDs: lowercase with underscores (e.g., \"goal_1\", \"opt_extend_trial\")\n- Stable topology: goal → decision → options → outcomes\n\nIf the brief is ambiguous or missing some details, you MUST still propose a simple but usable skeleton\ngraph that satisfies the minimum structure above.

What could go wrong?\n   - Create outcome nodes (positive results that contribute to goal)\n   - Create risk nodes (negative consequences that detract from goal)\n   - Require at least one outcome OR one risk.\n\n3. FACTORS: What variables influence those outcomes/risks?\n   - Controllable factors: User can change via options (must have data.value)\n   - Uncontrollable factors: External variables user cannot control (no data field)\n\n4. OPTIONS: What choices does the user have?\n   - Each option sets controllable factors to specific values\n   - Include status quo if only one option is implied\n   - Each option must have data.interventions\n   - Options must differ in at least one intervention\n\n5. DECISION: Frame the choice. Connect decision to all options.\n\n6. EDGES: Connect following the topology (decision→options→factors→outcomes/risks→goal)\n\n7. VALIDATE: Run the pre-flight checklist.
